\chapter{Motivation}\label{ch:motivation}

In addition to the numbered list introduced in \cref{sec:background2}, you can also use the unordered (or bullet) list as below.
For instance you may organize this chapter with the following flow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the weaknesses and remaining problems to be solved of the related studies introduced in \cref{ch:background}.
  \item Discuss the key observation/insight/hypothesis which led to the proposal of your thesis that aims at solving one of the problems explained above.
  \item Demonstrate the potential of your idea for instance through an initial experiment with ideal conditions (e.g., ideal parameters such as zero latency or infinite bandwidth).
  \item Using the results above motivate your study with quantitative evidence.
\end{itemize}
It might be better to explain the background and discuss your motivation in a single chapter.
In that case you may combine this chapter with \cref{ch:background}.

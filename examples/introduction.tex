\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

Write the introduction of the thesis.
Make sure you assume a reader who is not familiar with the research area.

Throughout the paper you should cite proper references\cite{bar:great2020coolname}.\footnote{I think you would cite at least 30 papers.}
List all the references in \texttt{main.bib} file and cite them using the \texttt{{\textbackslash}cite\{\}} command.
You can also cite multiple papers at once\cite{garply:happy2021anothercoolname,bar:great2020coolname}.
The \texttt{cite} package with \texttt{sort} option (which is enabled by default) allows sorting the references as in [1,~2] and not [2,~1], please compare with the previous sentence\cite{bar:great2020coolname,garply:happy2021anothercoolname}.
You do not need to manually add a space (using {\textasciitilde}) before the \texttt{{\textbackslash}cite\{\}} command because \texttt{cite} package takes care of it too.

You might want to decorate (using \textit{italic}, \textbf{bold} and \underline{underline}) certain words or sentences to emphasize important things.
In general \textit{italic} is the first choice in English.
One last thing, I believe writing one sentence in one line (in \LaTeX source code) is the best practice.

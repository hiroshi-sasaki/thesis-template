\chapter{Related Work}\label{ch:relatedwork}

Here you can introduce related work which are not as important as the ones you discussed in \cref{ch:background} but would help put your work into context.
Therefore, it is important to explain the important differences between your work and theirs.

Also beware it is ``Related Work'' and not ``Related Works''.

\section{Research Background: Part~1}\label{sec:background1}

Discuss the background (e.g., basic knowledge, related studies etc) of your research project.
As in \cref{ch:introduction}\footnote{Always use cleverref's {\textbackslash}cref\{\} command to reference sections, figures and tables. It will automatically use the format defined in main.tex so you do not need to deal with it on your own.} you need to assume your readers are not familiar with your research. Be kind.
Yet, don't be too talkative, be concise and to the point.

Also do not forget to change the section names inside {\textbackslash}section\{\}, for instance ``Research Background: Part~1'' is just an example.

\section{Research Background: Part~2}\label{sec:background2}

You may use ordered (or numbered) lists to better organize your thesis:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First item;
  \item second item; and
  \item the third.
\end{enumerate}
